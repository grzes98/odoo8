Set sale-line tax from a pricelist. It allows one to set different taxes to different pricelists and in consequence:
* remove taxes from international or tax-free sales
* set taxes that are included in prices (for b2c sales) for some partners and tax excluded prices for other (for b2b sales)
Here is how to make tax included prices for some partners:
* add a new tax that is included in price (accounting / taxes / taxes -> included in price)
* set this tax on a new pricelist
* make prices on the pricelist tax-included
* attach this pricelist to a partner
